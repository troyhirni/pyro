The pyro project is a python programming library built on a significant 
reorganization of code from the [aimy](http://aimy.sourceforge.net/) 
project, previously developed on sourceforge.net. The plan is to reorganize 
and optimize [the aimy project code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/aimy/), 
allowing (the code, as presented in pyro) to be potentially useful as the 
base for _any_ long-running, self-analyzing software - but specifically, 
for the next version of aimy. That is to say, once pyro reaches a sufficient 
level of stability and usability, the aimy project development will continue 
here on github in a separate project based on pyro. The development of pyro 
will also continue separately. Any updates to pyro will (sooner or later) 
be reflected in aimy, and any needs discovered in the development of aimy 
will help determine the course of pyro's development.
